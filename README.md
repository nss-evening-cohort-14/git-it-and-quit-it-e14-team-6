# Project Title
Git It and Quit It

# Description 
This project has four pages to help working developers store and connect in an efficient workspace. 

# List of Features 
Overview page:
Allows users to pin their repository by typing a title and link in the required text field. By clicking the submit button a card generates in the form of your repository. When you have no need for your repository anymore you can click the delete button and your repository will be removed.

Repository page:
Allows users to create repositories for storing code used as part of a project. A user also has the ability to input a description of the newly created repository, as well as delete the repository.

Packages page:
The Packages page has a "Add Package" Event Button Click to display the input form for packages. I have a reset invoked function that clears out all the input fields after the text is submitted. My save package cards display under the "Packages" banner and the deleted package cards then display under a "Deleted Packages" banner. After all saved package cards have been deleted a display text and image pops up to inform the user that all saved cards have been deleted.
